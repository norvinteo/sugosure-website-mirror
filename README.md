# SugoSure Website Mirror

This repository contains a mirror of the SugoSure website, a diabetes management platform. The website was downloaded using `wget` and processed to work on GitHub Pages.

## Structure

The website follows the original structure:
- www.sugosure.com/ - Main website
- app.sugosure.com/ - Application pages
- info.sugosure.com/ - Information pages
- cdn.prod.website-files.com/ - Assets and resources

## Viewing the Website

You can access the mirrored website at: https://norvinteo.github.io/sugosure-website-mirror/

The website is simplified and may not include all functionality of the original site. It is provided as a reference only.

## How This Mirror Was Created

1. Used wget to download the website recursively
2. Fixed broken links and paths
3. Organized assets in the same structure as the original site
4. Uploaded to GitHub and enabled GitHub Pages

## Notes

This mirror was created as part of a project to preserve the website after the company ceased operations. The notice on the website states: "due to the planned wind-down of ConnectedHealth Pte Ltd, SugoSure has ceased operations."
