              <p class="medium-text">The case of Patient 1 highlights that in a motivated patient, the benefits of SugoSure can be great.<br/><br/>Patient 1 is a 57-year old Chinese male patient who has had type 2 diabetes for 17 years. Prior to starting the Beta Test, he was "dissatisfied" with his diabetes management and felt he had "problems motivating myself and did not have enough support".<br/><br/>Weight has always been as issue for him (starting weight 90.4kg, BMI 31.2) and he was keen to try something different to help with weight loss and improve his diabetic management. Prior to starting SugoSure he monitored blood glucose only occasionally.<br/><br/>Patient 1 started the Beta Test with HbA1c of 7.4% managed with Diamicron, Janumet and Jardiance. At the start his blood glucose readings were erratic with variability of more than 20%. Fasting blood glucose readings ranged from 5.7 to 7.7 mmol/L and pre-dinner readings from 7.3 to 11.8mmol/L. He managed less than 5000 steps daily and ate at hawker stalls for most meals.<br/><br/>With feedback through the SugoSure app, health coach advice and support he changed his lifestyle radically. He increased his daily steps to consistently above 10,000 with a two-week average at end Beta Test of 15,366. Through a better understanding of portion sizes, more thoughtful food choices from hawker stalls and more home cooking he significantly improved his diet. As a result of these changes he lost weight steadily with a total loss of 5.3kg after 3 months.<br/><br/>Blood glucose patterns also stabilized with much reduced variability. This was reflected in a significant HBA1c drop by 1.4% to 6.0% after 3 months.<br/><br/>In his formal interview and feedback survey, Patient 1 "strongly agreed" that he enjoyed using the app. He found his health coach key to SugoSure – "she gives a morale booster" and also felt that the insights provided by his health coach to his doctor "made a difference in my management."<br/><br/>"My doctor has encouraged me to actively manage my diabetes for many years but I didn't know where to start. I am well aware of the complications of unmanaged diabetes and that is stressful. Now with SugoSure I have the tools and support to get things under control. I am more conscious of what I need to do and make a concerted effort to try and reach my goals."<br/></p>
