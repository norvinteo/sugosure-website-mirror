            <div class="pl-fade-in">
              <p class="medium-text">A good diabetes app should help you to log and track key indicators of your diabetes control: not only your blood glucose readings but also lifestyle measures including your diet, activity and weight. It should also give you feedback and support to help you make adjustments if needed to improve your diabetes control.<br/><br/>SugoSure does all this and more. It helps you to monitor a set of key diabetes indicators and learn more about any problems then address these through lifestyle changes.<br/><br/>The data you enter through the Patient App is analysed using specialised algorithms built into ConnectedHealth's Clinical Data Platform. It is shared with your doctor and health coach, enabling them to remotely monitor your progress.<br/></p>

            <div class="pl-fade-in">
              <p class="medium-text">Organisations such as the American Diabetes Association and the UK's National Institute for Clinical Excellence advocate five essential aspects of diabetes management that must be addressed by any diabetes management programme to conform to Good Clinical Practice. These are: a suitable diabetes diet, high levels of activity and exercises, weight management, medication management and blood sugar monitoring.<br/><br/>Adherence to these principles has been built into SugoSure's design so that the system tracks your data in relation to all five key areas, including your diabetes diet, exercises and weight management. Targets are set for your key indicator data as part of a Clinical Plan made by your doctor and a Lifestyle Plan developed in consultation with your health coach. SugoSure's digital health guidance and feedback then supports implementation of your plans to make sustainable improvements and reach your targets.<br/></p>
